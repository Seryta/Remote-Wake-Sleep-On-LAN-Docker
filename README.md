A docker image of [sciguy14/Remote-Wake-Sleep-On-LAN-Server](https://github.com/sciguy14/Remote-Wake-Sleep-On-LAN-Server)

The Remote Wake/Sleep-on-LAN Server (RWSOLS) is a simple webapp that runs on Docker to remotely power up any computer via WOL. This is necesarry, since WOL packages (Layer 2) cannot be forwarded via a normal VPN (Layer 3).
